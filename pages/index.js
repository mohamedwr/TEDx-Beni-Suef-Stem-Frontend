								<Word>“Ideas Worth Spreading”</Word>. TEDx
								brings the spirit of TED to local communities
								around the globe through TEDx events. These
								events are organized by passionate individuals
								who seek to uncover new ideas and to share the
								latest research in their local areas that spark
								conversations in their communities. TEDx events
								include live speakers and recorded TED Talks,
								and are organized independently under a free
								license granted by TED. These events are not
								controlled by TED, but event organizers agree to
								abide by our format, and are offered guidelines
								for curation, speaker coaching, event organizing
								and more. They learn from us and from each
								other. More than 3000 events are now held
								annually.{" "}

								“IDEAS WORTH SPREADING”, under this slogan,
								TEDxYouth@BeniSuefSTEM has arisen as a nonprofit
								organization. It holds events where Technology,
								Entertainment, Design, science, business, and
								global issues converge. Hence, we set up a
								community of curious souls to spread various
								thoughts through our local event with shined
								speakers who have meaningful messages and aspire
								to put their unique fingerprints. Thus, our
								mission as a TEDx distributor in BS STEM School
								is to spread TED&apos;s valuable aims in
								BeniSuef, exposing insights, beliefs, and
								inspirations. They can rise with us. It makes
								the subtle ideas soar in the sky of our society
								because we have the faith in every thought which
								was rejected before. And we spot the light on;
								the intrinsic ideas deserve the opportunity to
								raise in our community, turning from being
								rejected to respected because they are “IDEAS
								WORTH SPREADING“.
