							“IDEAS WORTH SPREADING”, under this slogan,
							TEDxYouth@BeniSuefSTEM has arisen as a nonprofit
							organization. It holds events where Technology,
							Entertainment, Design, science, business, and global
							issues converge. Hence, we set up a community of
							curious souls to spread various thoughts through our
							local event with shined speakers who have meaningful
							messages and aspire to put their unique
							fingerprints. Thus, our mission as a TEDx
							distributor in BS STEM School is to spread
							TED&apos;s valuable aims in BeniSuef, exposing
							insights, beliefs, and inspirations. They can rise
							with us. It makes the subtle ideas soar in the sky
							of our society because we have the faith in every
							thought which was rejected before. And we spot the
							light on; the intrinsic ideas deserve the
							opportunity to raise in our community, turning from
							being rejected to respected because they are “IDEAS
							WORTH SPREADING“.
